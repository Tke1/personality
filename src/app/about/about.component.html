  <h1>Who We Are</h1>
  <h3>We started Wag Match in 2017 to help returned shelter dogs to find their mates. During St.Louis Puria
    Hackerton,
    we realized that the return rate of adopted dogs from animal shelters in St. Louis area is high. To us, this is
    a
    heartbreaking news. With this application, we enable shelter administrators to find a potential owner for their
    dogs
    using scientific method. </h3>
